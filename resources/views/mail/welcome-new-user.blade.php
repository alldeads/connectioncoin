Welcome to Connection Coin, a community of people who believe intentional, positive connections between friends, co-workers and even strangers can change the world.

Through Connection Coin you can give, receive and track coins with positive sayings and unique pin numbers as they pass from person to person spreading positivity, love, and encouragement. Think of "Paying It Forward" that is trackable! Our goal is that each coin in circulation is passed again and again, creating countless positive face to face connections for people from all over the world. We hope to inspire a return to real life interactions by sharing and celebrating the stories and moments of connection on our news feed. 

<p><b>Received a coin?</b></p>
We can't wait to hear about your connection! Click the "Create Connection" button and enter the number and phrase of the coin you received. Share the story of how you received the coin and a picture that tells the story of the connection. This information will show up in the connections news feed on our site with all of the other connections being made. Be sure to create your profile to track where the coin goes and include a cover picture, bio and links to your social media if you like. Now it's your turn to pass the coin to the next person! Want to create even more connections? Follow steps below!
