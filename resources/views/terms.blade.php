                    <p> Welcome to Connection Coin!</p>

                    <p> Connection Coin provides a service that enables people to connect with each other in a more meaningful way. These Terms govern your use of Connection Coin and the Products are provided to you by Connection Coin LLC.</p>

                    <p> We don't charge you to use Connection Coin or the other Products and services covered by these Terms. You do however have the option to buy coins to give out as part of our broader mission to bring people together through connections. </p>

                    <p> We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you (such as your name, email address or other contact information).</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li> 
                            <p> The services we provide</p>

                            <p> Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:</p>

                            <p> Your experience on Connection Coin is unlike anyone else's: from the posts, stories, messages, and other content you see in the Connections Feed to the people you connect with and other features you might use, such as the Coin Store, Map, and search. </p>

                            <p> We empower you to express yourself and communicate about what matters to you:
                            There are many ways to express yourself on Connection Coin and to communicate with friends, family, and others about what matters to you - for example, sharing comments, photos, videos, and stories across Connection Coin, sending messages to a friend or connecting to other social media platforms available on your profile. We have also developed, and continue to explore, new ways for people to use technology, such as providing virtual coins for in-person meetups.
                            </p>

                            <p> Combat harmful conduct and protect and support our community:</p>

                            <p> People will only build community on Connection Coin if they feel safe. We do our best to detect misuse of our platform, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able to help support or protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement. We reserve the right to limit or remove anyone's access to the platform for misuse of Connection Coin, or any other member of the community.</p>

                            <p> Research ways to make our services better:
                            We engage in research to develop, test, and improve our Products. This includes analyzing the data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. 
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p> Your commitments to Connection Coin and our community</p>

                            <p> We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <p> Who can use Connection Coin</p>

                                    <p> When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li> Use the same name that you use in everyday life.</li>
                                        <li> Provide accurate information about yourself.</li>
                                        <li> Create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for personal purposes.</li>
                                        <li> Not share your password, give access to your Connection Coin account to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p> We try to make Connection Coin broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use Connection Coin if:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li> You are under 13 years old.</li>
                                        <li> You are a convicted sex offender.</li>
                                        <li> We've previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms or Policies.</li>
                                        <li> You are prohibited from receiving our Products, services, or software under applicable laws.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p> What you can share and do on Connection Coin</p>

                                    <p> We want people to use Connection Coin to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li> 
                                            <p> You may not use our Products to do or share anything:</p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li> That violates these Terms, our Community Standards, and other terms and policies that apply to your use of Connection Coin.</li>
                                                <li> That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.</li>
                                                <li> That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>

                                        <li> <p> You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of our Products.</p></li>

                                        <li> <p> You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.</p></li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p> We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions.
                                    If we remove content that you have shared in violation of our Community Standards, we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.
                                    To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p> The permissions you give us</p>
                                    <p> We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li> 
                                            <p> Permission to use content you create and share:</p>
                                            <p> Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.</p>
                                            <p> You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Connection Coin. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.</p>
                                            <p> However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a 'license') to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.</p>
                                            <p> Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on Connection Coin, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as service providers that support our service or other Connection Coin you use. This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems.</p>

                                            <p> You can delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account. </p>

                                            <p> When you delete content, it's no longer visible to other users, however it may continue to exist elsewhere on our systems where:</p>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li> immediate deletion is not possible due to technical limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted within a maximum of 90 days from when you delete it);</li>
                                                <li> your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or</li>
                                                <li> where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:</li>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li> investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);</li>
                                                    <li> comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or</li>
                                                    <li> comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;</li>
                                                </ul>
                                            </ul>

                                            <p> In which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).
                                            In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the content has been fully deleted.
                                            </p>
                                        </li>



                                        <li>
                                            <p> Permission to update software you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p> Limits on using our intellectual property</p>

                                    <p> If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on Connection Coin), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                        <li> 
                            <p> Additional provisions</p>

                            <ol>
                                <li> 
                                    <p> Updating our Terms</p>
                                    <p> We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.
                                    We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the Connection Coin community, you can delete your account at any time.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p> Account suspension or termination</p>
                                    <p>We want Connection Coin to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.
                                    If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community Standards, we may suspend or permanently disable access to your account. We may also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Where we take such action we'll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; or where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.
                                    You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your account by mistake.
                                    If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 3, 4.2-4.5.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                    <p> Limits on liability</p>
                                    <p> We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content).</p>
                                    <p>We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the Connection Coin Products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Connection Coin Products will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.</p>
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                        <li>
                            <p> Disputes</p>
                            <p> We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.</p>
                            <p> For any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the Connection Coin Products ("claim"), you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for North Carolina or a state court located in Mecklenburg County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of North Carolina will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>

                            <ol>
                                <li>These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and Connection Coin LLC. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.</li>
                                <li>Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.</li>
                                <li>If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.</li>

                                <li>You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialized. Only your legacy contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon death or incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is memorialized.</li>
                                <li>These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.</li>
